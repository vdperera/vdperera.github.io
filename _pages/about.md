I am a member of technical staff at [Tenyx](https://www.tenyx.com) where I work on everything pertaining to NLP (from NLU to NLG to synthetic data generation) with the ambitious goal of building the next generation of intelligent voice-based agents.

Previously, I worked as applied scientist at Amazon Lab 126 in the [Alexa Conversations](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/conversations/about-alexa-conversations.html) group. During my tenure at Amazon I focused on controllable–both semantically and stylistically–natural language generation (NLG) at scale.

I earned my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University working with Prof. [Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/). My thesis explored how to enable bidirectional human-robot interaction. In the human-to-robot direction, I developed algorithms to let a mobile service robot understand requests to perform tasks, and questions about its experience. In the robot-to-human direction, I enabled the robot to provide explanations about the task it executed with a level of detail that matches the user’s request.

Prior to CMU, I was a master student in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at [Sapienza University](https://www.uniroma1.it/en) in Rome where I also got my B.S. in Computer Engeneering.
